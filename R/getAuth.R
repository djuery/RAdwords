#' @title Authentication of R app
#' 
#' @description getAuth authenticates the R app at the Google authentication server using OAUTH2 and receives the client token.
#' Usually you need not to run getAuth() explicitly since the whole authentication process is managed by \code{\link{doAuth}}.
#' 
#' @importFrom utils browseURL
#' 
#' @return Client token from Google authentication server.
#' Dataframe with the credential information which is cached in working space 
#' and optionally saved as RData file in current working directory.
getAuth = function() {
  # This function asks for the credentials (Client Id, Client Secret) from the Api project,
  # the developer token from the Adwords MCC and retrieves the client token from the Google authentication server.
  # Moreover credentials optionally can be saved to the current working directory and .gitignore is generated for credentials.
  #
  # Inputs:
  #   Client Id from Google Api project.
  #   Client secret from Google Api project.
  #   Developer token from Adwords MCC.
  # 
  # Returns:
  #   Client token from Google authentication server.
